make a 3xN grid which contains data for the map data. It will be stored in a 15 long array with a max range of 3x5. 

fuction for: 

- giving menu
- generating map
- Save map data to CSV (using the CSV from github repo: https://github.com/vincentlaucsb/csv-parser)



In the end it did not work fully as planned. The Github repo I used ended up not working as intended thus switched to a new CSV repo but did not work fully as needed. Additinally, We have added an ability to add custom set of tiles.
